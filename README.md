Help MWR pages be more user friendly.

MWR uses customised scroll bar for pages like [this one](http://www.mwr.gov.cn/zwgk/gknr/202307/t20230727_1676161.html). This Tempermonkey script does this:

- Remove the annoying scroll bar of the content, which is absolutely useless.
- Add css styles for printing to save paper.

## How to use

1. Open [Tempermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) dashboard in your browser
1. Create a new user script
1. Copy content of `mwr.js`
2. Paste to the user script you created and save.
